# to-do-list-backend
* I've spent about 5h on the solution
* The backend (this) solution was written in Visual Studio 2019. It should build and run out-of-the-box.
* Picked the design that i use in everyday job
* Had problem consuming the WebAPI with CORS and spent most of the time debugging that. Used Postman and the calls worked.
